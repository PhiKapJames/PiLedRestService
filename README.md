PiLedRestService
================
This is the code that I used in the post at https://www.scribblingbrain.com/2013/11/07/controlling-a-rgb-led-attached-to-a-raspberry-pi-through-android.  I created this to play around with turning the LED on and off on a Raspberry Pi utilizing a quick REST service.  This needs more work on cleanup and multi-threaded handling of resources and setup / tear down.
